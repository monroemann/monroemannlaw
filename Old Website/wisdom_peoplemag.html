    <h2 class="text-center">Someone Has to Be on the Next Cover of People Magazine, Right?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-center">by Dr. Monroe Mann, PhD, Esq, MBA, LLM, ME</h4>
    <br>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
        
        <p>Have you ever read People Magazine?  Or something similar, like InTouch Weekly, Star, Vogue, Paris Match, etc.?</p>

        <p>I'm sure you have.  And here's something you may not have noticed, at least not consciously: on every issue, new people are on the cover.  Sounds like an obvious statement, but if you think about it, it's very inspiring.</p>

        <p>Every week, new people.  Sometimes it's someone who is already famous, but... just as often, it's someone who is an up and comer.  Just as often, you'll see someone's name or face you don't even recognize.</p> 

        <p>Who are those people you don't recognize?  Those people are you.  Next week.</p>

        <p>You see, everyone who is famous today--wasn't always famous.  Sure, you can argue that someone born into showbiz royalty is 'famous' as soon as they are born, but that's not accurate.  Most people can't name the children of big celebrities unless those children themselves become famous in their own right.</p>

        <p>Here's my point: you too can become famous.  You too can grace the cover of the next People Magazine.</p>

        <p>"Oh but it's so hard to get there!" you scream.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      
      <p>Not necessarily.  All you need to do is do something that's more interesting than the other people they are considering.</p> 

      <p>Need some ideas?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do something truly newsworthy.</li>
          <li>Get critical acclaim for some creative project you are working on.</li>
          <li>Get cast in a major television show or movie.</li>
          <li>Write a book that storms the best seller lists.</li>
          <li>Post something on the internet that launches like a virus.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>Maybe you're still thinking, "But those things are so hard to do!"  Well with that attitude, it's clear you like to do more complaining than moving.  How to do something newsworthy: do SOMETHING.  Take action!  Maybe it piques the interest of reporters.  How to get cast in a major movie?  Go on auditions!  Join an acting class!  Network with others!   The point is: the more you do, the more likely you'll do something that gets you noticed by these magazines.</p>

      <p>Actually, there's a bigger point: let this be a reminder to you that EVERY WEEK a new star is born.  You may be struggling now, and not have a huge fanbase, but...   that all could change in a week, <em>if you keep pushing forward</em></p>

      <p>Meet you at the top!</p>
