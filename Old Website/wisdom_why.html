        <p>So What is the Power of Why?</p>

        <p>Many self-help books lately discuss the important of 'why', but most discuss it in a superficial manner, never stressing the absolute NECESSITY of figuring our not just your way, but your STRONG why.</p>

        <p>Have you heard the saying, "If you have a strong enough why, you can figure out the how."  If not, here it is.  If so, really think about that.</p>

        <p>Your 'why' determines absolutely EVERYTHING.  It determines when you wake up in the morning.  It determines if you sleep late.  It determines how much time you spend every day in pursuit of your goals.  It determine how much time you spend figuring out your goals.  And most importantly, in most cases, it determines if you ever reach your goals.</p>

        <p>Do you know why most people don't reach their goals, dreams, and ambitions?  It's because they have a terrible why.  In most cases, they don't even know what their why is.  Or if they do, it's a selfish why.  And let me assure you, selfish whys are the weakest whys.  Why?  Because it's all about you.  If you fail, the only person who loses is you.  But when you make your why about other people, suddenly, if you fail, OTHERS are affected.  And therein lies the beginning of the creation of a strong why.</p>

        <p>So what's the solution here?</p>

        <p>First, you need to recognize that the reason you accomplish things or not is all about how strong your why is.</p>

      </div> <!-- close col div -->  

      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
      
        <p>Second, you need to recognize that for every dream, you need to identify the why.  In other words, ask yourself, "Why is it important that I do this?" and really take the time to answer the question, and better yet, write it down.  For example, as I write this, my sleep schedule is all messed up because I pulled an all-nighter last week to launch <a href="https://www.breakdiving.io" target="_blank">BreakDiving.io</a> and I've been up until 4am every night since struggling to fall asleep at a decent hour.  The only solution: I have to force myself tomorrow to wake up at 8am, and then force myself to stay awake until 9pm, with no naps.  WHY?  Because if I don't, this maddening sleep schedule is going to continue for week, or months, and I'm tired of it.</p>
        
        <p>But is that 'why' really strong enough?  The answer is no.  Why?  Because the only person affected is... me.  So let's try again.  Why do I need to get into a regular sleep schedule?  Answer: So I can be a better leader for my team at Break Diving, and offer better customer support for my legal clients.  Because by going to bed at 4am, and waking at 11, I wake up to a flurry of emails and texts and Slack messages that have been waiting three hours for a response.</p>  

        <p>Ahh, suddenly getting back to a normal sleep schedule has more importance and more urgency.  Truly, why haven't I solved it these last 8 days?  Answer: my 'why' was terrible.  Why?  Because I was only thinking of myself, and not the others who are impacted by my nocturnal prison.  Suddenly, as I write this, I realize I need to get back into the realm of the living, and tomorrow, I am GOING to wake up at 8am, regardless of when I end up falling asleep tonight.  Why?  Because the why is strong enough.</p>  

        <p>You need to do the same exercise with everything you want to do in life, and everything you 'say' you want to do but never end up doing.  Why don't you ever end up doing these things?  Because either you don't care, or you haven't really analyzed your dreams all that carefully.</p>  

        <p>So please, take the time to figure out your 'why'.  It's one of the best time management tools I know.</p>
