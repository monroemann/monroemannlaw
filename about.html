        <h2>Why Me?</h2>
        <p>It's hard to choose a good attorney/financial planner/business coach these days.  I'm going to make the choice easy for you.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm really good at what I do and am someone who you'll enjoy working with.</li>
            <li>My fees are lower and more fair than you'll find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I'm probably the only person you know who is an attorney with a PhD, an MBA in finance, a Masters in Entrepreneurship, and a Masters of Laws... who is also a bronze-star nominated Iraq war vet... who also lived in Shanghai, China for a year teaching English... who won an Ostrich riding tournament in South Africa... who (well, you get the picture)!</li>
            <li>I'm one of the few attorneys and financial planners you will meet who actually practices what he practices--I'm a SAG/AFTRA/Equity actor; a successful published author, a successful feature filmmaker; a successful musician; a successful public speaker; a successful business owner; a successful not-for-profit 'business owner'; and the list goes on.  And yes, I've even got my own financial emergency funds, stock portfolios, IRA, life insurance, and five year plan--precisely what I want to help you create for yourself as well.</li>
            <li>Google me for more info, and check out IMDb, Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, BreakDiving.org, SaveOurTappanZee.org, and the list goes on.</li>
            <li>You can also read many <a href="testimonials.html">testimonials about my work</a>.
          </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>Oddly, I didn't become an attorney and financial planner to get clients.  Not initially.  At first, I became an attorney and financial planner simply to manage my own career, businesses, and life more efficiently and successfully.  I then realized that others needed the same help I gave myself.  This is why my rates are lower than most: I didn't get into this for the money; I am doing this first and foremost because I don't want you to get screwed!  I care about you and want to help you navigate this crazy world a little more easily!</p>
        <p>It's because of my unique background that I probably know implicitly what you are going through.  Why?  Because I have probably already lived through it myself!  As a result, I understand my clients far better than most of my competition.</p>
        <p>In the end, this all translates to a much more fun working relationship, a far greater likelihood that we more quickly end up on the same page, and a client (that's you) who leaves happy, educated, protected, and ready to take on the world.</p>
        <p>I really look forward to working with you!</p>
