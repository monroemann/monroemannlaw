        <h2>Why Us?</h2>
        <p>It's hard to choose a good attorney these days.  I'm going to make the choice easy for you.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm an incredible attorney who you'll enjoy working with because I'm also friendly and nice.</li>
            <li>My fees are lower and more fair than you'll find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I'm probably the only attorney you'll find with a PhD, an MBA in finance, a Masters in Entrepreneurship, and a Masters of Laws.</li>
            <li>I'm one of the few attorneys you will meet who actually practices what he practices--I'm a SAG/AFTRA/Equity actor; a successful published author, a successful feature filmmaker; a successful musician; a succesful public speaker; a sucessful business owner; a successful not-for-profit 'business owner'; and the list goes on.  Google me for more info, and check out IMDb, Amazon, iTunes, YouTube, BreakDiving.org, SaveOurTappanZee.org, and the list goes on.</li>
          </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>You see, I didn't become an attorney to get clients.  I became an attorney to manage my own career and businesses more efficiently and successfully.  I am still the lead attorney on all of my own projects.</p>
        <p>So I know implicitly what you are going through because... I have probably already lived through it yourself in some capacity.  I understand my clients far better than most of my competition.  That translates to a much more fun working relationship, and a far greater likelihood that we more quickly end up on the same page.</p>
