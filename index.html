I've read dozens of books that are meant to help the actor, but NONE come even close to the clear-cut book you so brilliantly wrote.  I now see my career in a whole new light, and can actually see the my being a success is within my power.  Your class was nothing short of amazing.  I walked away with the tools to get started on planning my own future and being my own boss.  I can ONLY become a success now that I have the right plan, tools, and attitude to succeed in this world.  In fact, I think every small business person should take your classes.

In the meantime I purchased his book “The Theatrical Juggernaut” and started reading it. Wow! Talk about motivation, I felt totally empowered after just the first chapter. In the meantime, I had auditioned for a legit agent who was very interested in me but explained that they had two other actors, who were “my type”, who always booked for them. But he kept my headshots and said, “you never know what might change.” After reading “The Theatrical Juggernaut”, I felt so “unstoppable” that I wrote a letter to this agent, included movie tickets and told him to go to the movies and spot roles that he could have cast me in. A couple of days later he called informing me that he was going to sign me. If I hadn’t read Monroe’s book I would not have an agent right now. My actions in getting this agent were directly due to “The Theatrical Juggernaut”. Thanks Monroe!! I have signed up for Monroe’s class and I can wait to conquer the business.&rdquo;</p>

Some of the films I have produced are “Gremlins”, “Innerspace”, “The ‘burbs”, “Deceived”, “Matinee”, and “Small Soldiers”.  I met Monroe Mann recently through a friend who works for CNN who interviewed him for a segment about army reservists and their outside lives, Monroe being a reservist who is also an actor. I was immediately struck by his intelligence and determination to succeed.  Unlike many equally ambitious young people who want to get into show business, I feel Monroe has the seriousness of purpose and work ethic to pull it off. In the few short months I have known him, he has co-written a screenplay, enlisted a professional sports organization to cooperate with the production, attached a known actor, and put the movie on the road to actually being produced. This is an amazing accomplishment for someone with no inside connections in the industry whatsoever, who has had to rely on nothing more than his own commitment and drive to get things done.  I have no doubts that Monroe Mann will succeed in this endeavor and any others he sets his mind to.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;I read Monroe Mann's first book "Theatrical Juggernaut," while on sabbatical in California. I was blown away! It was such a wake up call, and a revelation!! One of my favorite lines in this highly inspirational as well as educational book is "The best time to give it your all is when you’ve got nothing left to give." Well, I was exactly at that point. So, I took the leap of faith upon returning to New York, and enrolled in Unstoppable Artists. An intensely thought provoking and truly business enhancing class. Mr. Mann sets forth the importance of running your business as an entrepreneur. Developing an understanding and the use of PMA and how to incorporate it. Expounds on the importance of visibility, and attitude. Gaining and keeping clarity in your business, your business strategy and personal style. Not only is Mr. Mann an incredibly positive and unstoppable force in person, but he is also a wonderful teacher and coach. In fact I would take the course again, to brush up and reinforce all of the invaluable techniques and business sense he imparted. My business and personal style are forever changed. Though I am still implementing, and learning how to incorporate everything we have absorbed over the last five week intensive workshop, I know that I am on my way, and walking away from a course, that has and will change the course of my life. I recommend Monroe Mann to anyone who wants to enhance their business "know how," and who is serious about success. Put a kick in your pants to get your dreams up and off the ground, become a CEO & CSO and enroll in any of Monroe's courses! Thank you Monroe Mann! Lastly, in graduating from the Monroe's program, I am proud to have added to my personal network an alumni of incredibly talented individuals.&rdquo;</p>

Monroe's book gives us all hope, whether we're actors or not, to develop and live our dreams and make what we individually envision part of our physical collective reality.  His class is dynamic and chock full of information about the actor as a business person and ONLY as a business person--a new way of thinking about one's acting career to jolt us all out of our complacency.  In fact, the class NEEDS to be expanded, as there are so many questions from his students that the time allotted is far too short!  Unstoppable Actors [ed. note. my former company name] needs to expand for these reasons and many others I haven't even mentioned.
